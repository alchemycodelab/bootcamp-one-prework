# Preparing For Success: Pre-work

### Success Indicators and Outcomes

One of the biggest indicators of post-graduation success we've seen is how well students keep up on lab work and apply themselves to stretch goals in homework assignments. Starting an intensive coding program like Alchemy can be overwhelming, much like traveling to a foreign country where you don’t know the language or culture.

**We ask that all students take this preparation work seriously.** While most students adjust to the pace and intensity of the program over the first week or two, some students find that the adjustment period can create a cycle of incomplete work, struggle, and demoralizing outcomes that takes much longer to break.

We want you to have the best outcome possible, which is why we're asking you to go through this material on your own, in order to develop familiarity while practicing using your laptop as a development tool.  
Focus on putting in the hours and dedication, but _don’t worry about comprehension!_ This may seem counterintuitive, but our instructors will cover the material again, in different ways, while adding more practical knowledge applications.

To summarize:

1. **Avoid skipping, skimming, or skimping out on prework.** Invest in yourself and your future career by taking the opportunity to expose yourself to the vast amount of information available online.
    > _Before the start of Bootcamp I commit to working through all of the tutorials, being curious, and seeking out further knowledge._  
1. **The purpose of prework is exposure and familiarity, not comprehension or competency.** It is likely that you'll have way more questions than answers. The material may go over your ahead, things may still not make sense, and you probably haven't gained the ability to execute the material on your own. That's ok!  
You are being exposed to knowledge, syntax, and language-- which is not the same thing as knowing how to do something. The goal is for you to gain some base familiarity and pattern recognition, which will help you during actual class time when these topics are discussed in-depth.  
Imagine you are about to embark on a 6 month stay in a foreign country and you want to watch movies and videos, read about things to do, and learn some basic conversational how-to and etiquette. That's what the prework is for!
    > _Before the start of my training at Alchemy, I'm committed to working broadly across the tutorials and getting some exposure to all of the topics._  
 
 Prioritize the terminal and git tutorials, but don't go so deep that you sacrifice getting JavaScript, HTML and CSS exposure.

### Pre-work

**The pre-work for Code 102 is mandatory and counts as 5% of your Code 102 total course grade.** You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments in our Learning Management System shortly after you've completed the enrollment process.

Start as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

There's no such thing as too much preparation before you begin at Alchemy. We have listed additional tutorials and materials, plus there is a wealth of free information online, so feel free to branch out and practice your search skills.

## Code 201

This class provides a solid foundation from which to begin the program. Having familiarity with the material being covered allows the students to keep up with the intensive lab work from day one, and prevent being overwhelmed by the amount of new
material being presented daily.

Code 201 **requires students to complete the prework assigned for the program**. The prework gives enrolled students a clear, step-by-step guide for what they need to achieve **before they start classes**. Online resources can give students a good first look at the material. We understand that some things will still be confusing and may not make sense. That's ok!

## Online Tutorials

### Practice the Terminal _(1-2 hours)_

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line.

If you aren't already, this is a great time to get used to the command line. No matter which operating system you're using, this tutorial can help you feel confident using the command line to navigate your computer:

https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial

Please work through Sections 1 through 5 of this tutorial. Note: This tutorial is for everyone, even though the word "Linux" is in the title! The same commands work in Windows and MacOS terminals as well.

Also recommended from this tutorial: Section 14, which is a handy cheatsheet of commands. Feel free to explore the more advanced topics if you wish, but those topics are beyond the scope of the Code 201 course!

Using the terminal may feel a little scary at first, but stick with it and give it some practice. This is you, in charge of your computer. :]

### Git tutorials _(1-2 hours)_

**A.** There is a lot of useful information in the Udemy tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. Skim through it as you can while striving to acquire terminology and gaining an understanding of the large concepts. Learning about version control is one of the most challenging things in the first week of Code 201. Above all, for now, strive for a conceptual understanding of how version control works, and why we use it in software development. The details are much more easy to grasp once the concepts are in place.

**B.** For a little hands-on practice, complete the first three exercises in the following tutorial:

[https://learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org)

1. Introduction to Git Commits
1. Branching in Git
1. Merging in Git

## Purchase textbooks and read preliminary readings

### Purchase the required textbooks

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Web Design with HTML &amp; CSS; JavaScript &amp; jQuery book set</a> by Jon Duckett

### Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class _(2-3 hours)_

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

- From the **HTML & CSS** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
- From the **JavaScript** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word, because we cover hundreds of pages of text in the first two weeks of the course. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. And be sure to read closely enough to come up with questions and observations based on your reading!
