# Preparing For Success: Prep-Work

## Why is this prep work important?

#### Success Indicators and Outcomes

**We ask that all students take this preparation work seriously, regardless of prior education or code exposure.** 
While most students adjust to the pace and intensity of the program over the first week or two, some students find that the adjustment period can create a cycle of incomplete work, struggle, and demoralizing outcomes that takes much longer to break.

We want you to have the best outcome possible, which is why we're asking you to go through this material on your own, in order to develop familiarity while practicing using your laptop as a development tool.  
Focus on putting in the hours and dedication, but _donâ€™t worry about comprehension!_ This may seem counterintuitive, but our instructors will cover the material again, in different ways, while adding more practical knowledge applications.

**Avoid skipping, skimming, or skimping out on prep work.** Invest in yourself and your future career by taking the opportunity to expose yourself to some of the vast amount of information available online.

**The purpose of this prep work is to give you exposure and familiarity, _not_ comprehension or competency.** 
It is likely that you'll have way more questions than answers. The material may go over your head, things may still not make sense, and you probably haven't gained the ability to execute the material on your own. That's ok!  

You are being exposed to knowledge, syntax, and language-- which is not the same thing as knowing how to do something. The goal is for you to gain some base familiarity and pattern recognition, which will help you during actual class time when these topics are discussed in-depth.  

Prioritize the terminal and git tutorials, but don't go so deep that you sacrifice getting JavaScript, HTML and CSS exposure.

#### Grade % 

**This prep work is mandatory and counts as 5% of your Code 102 total course grade.** You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments shortly after you've completed the enrollment process.

**Expect to spend a _minimum_ of several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed.** Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

#### Required for Code 201

Code 201 **requires students to complete this prep work assigned for the program**. This prep 
work gives enrolled students a clear, step-by-step guide for what they need to achieve **before they start classes**. We understand that some things will still be confusing and may not make sense. That's ok!

## Time Considerations

#### The estimated time to complete all of the prep work outlined below (_not including breaks_) is **from 23 hours to 78 hours**.

* If you spend only an approximate 23 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **4 hours a day for 5 days**.

* If you spend approximately 45 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **6 hours a day for 7 days**.

* If you spend approximately 78 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **5 hours a day for 16 days**.

# All Steps, In Order _(time to complete per item)_:

## Install programs and set up your computer _(1-3 hours depending on your network speed)_

* [Computer Setup Instructions](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/computer-setup)
* Following completion of these installations, you should:
* Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
* Type `git --version` in your terminal and not receive an error
* Be able to open VSCode from the Terminal or Git Bash by typing `code .`
* Have Slack installed so we can communicate as a class.
* Have a GitHub account on Github.com (please select a professional username, employers will be looking at it!)

---

## Email Your Instructors _(5-15 minutes)_

[Email your instructors](mailto:instruction@alchemycodelab.com) and introduce yourself.

---

## Introduce yourself on Slack _(15-30 minutes)_

**[Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)**

* We use Slack to share resources, chat, make announcements, and collaborate.
* You will receive an invitation to our class team. (You should be invited within 2 weeks of the start date for your class. If you have not been added by that time, please contact admissions.)
* Once you have joined our class team, add a nice profile picture of your lovely face. Then say hello in your class team, and introduce yourself.
* We welcome you to list your preferred pronoun next to your name here in Slack (top left drop down bar, select Profile & Account, Choose Edit Profile and then include your pronouns under `Display Name` (she/her, they/them, etc).
_As a place that values all people, we thank you for joining us in showing your support._

## Online Tutorials _(33-70 hours total)_

### Practice the Terminal _(1-2 hours)_

**[Bash Command Line Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial)**

**Please work through Sections 1 through 5 of this tutorial.** Note: This tutorial is for everyone, even though the word "Linux" is in the title! The same commands work in Windows and MacOS terminals as well.

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line.

**Also recommended from this tutorial: Section 14, which is a handy cheatsheet of commands.** Feel free to explore the more advanced topics if you wish, but those topics are beyond the scope of the Code 201 course!

### Git Tutorials _(1-2 hours)_

**[Git Tutorial, A Comprehensive Guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide)**

There is a lot of useful information in this tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. **Skim through it**, while striving to acquire terminology and gain an understanding of the large concepts. Learning about version control is one of the most challenging things in the first week of Code 201. Above all, for now, aim for a conceptual understanding of how version control works, and why we use it in software development.


**[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)**

**Please only complete the following 3 sections of the Learn Git Branching tutorial:**
  1. Introduction to Git Commits
  1. Branching in Git
  1. Merging in Git

### JavaScript Tutorials _(15-40 hours)_

**_(Note: These must be completed before first day of class)_**

**[Intro to Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)**

**[JavaScript Exercises](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/20690)** (Note: you do not need to complete all exercises available, aim for 10-20)

### HTML and CSS Tutorials _(15-25 hours)_

**_(Note: These must be completed before first day of class)_**

**[Intro to HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)**

**[Intro to CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)**

---

## Textbooks and Preliminary Reading _(2-3 hours total)_

### Purchase the required textbooks _(5-10 minutes)_

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

**[Web Design with HTML & CSS; JavaScript & jQuery book set by Jon Duckett](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=)**

### Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class _(2-3 hours)_

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. 

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to **read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments** in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

**From the _HTML & CSS_ textbook:**
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
  
**From the _JavaScript_ textbook:**
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"
