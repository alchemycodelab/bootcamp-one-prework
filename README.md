Preparing For Success: Pre-work for Bootcamp and Bootcamp Prep
===

## Bootcamp Part One: Foundations of Software Development

### Success Indicators and Outcomes

One of the biggest indicators we see in graduates of our program getting good paying jobs quickly is how well 
students keep up on lab work and apply themselves to stretch goals. Starting an intensive bootcamp program can be overwhelming, much like travelling to a foreign country where you don’t know the language or culture.

While most students adjust to the pace and intensity over the first week or so, for some the adjustment period can create a habit of incomplete work, struggle, and demoralizing outcomes that takes much longer to break.

This is why _we ask all students to take preparation seriously!_ We are asking you to go through material on your own to develop familiarity and practice using your laptop as a development tool. Focus on putting in the hours and dedication, but don’t worry about comprehension! This may seem counterintuitive, but our instructors will cover the material again, in different ways and adding more practical application. And once you start focusing on delivering labs and projects, you won’t be able to escape the things you need to know!

### Pre-work

The pre-work for Bootcamp Part One is mandatory and counts as 5% of your total course grade. You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments in our Learning Management System shortly after you've completed the enrollment process. 

Start as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

## Bootcamp Prep

This class provides a solid foundation from which to begin the bootcamp program. Having a
familiarity of the material being covered allows students to keep up with the intensive lab work
from Day One of the Bootcamp program and prevent being overwhelmed by the amount of new
material.

All students are encourage to attend our Bootcamp Prep course, though it is not strictly required. Bootcamp Prep requires the same prework listed here, but offers students a week of evenings with an instructor to review high-level concepts and answer questions - as well as tips and tricks for getting the most out of your computer and the covered material. Contact admissions@alchemycodelab.com for more information.

Bootcamp Prep **requires students to complete the prework for Bootcamp One**. The prework gives enrolled Bootcamp Prep Students a clear, step-by-step guide of what they
need to achieve **before they walk into the first night of Bootcamp Prep**. Online resources can
give students a good first look at the material. We understand that some things will still be
confusing and may not make sense.

Students should keep a journal of topics for which they have questions or find confusing. During
Bootcamp Prep, the instructor will do a high-level review of all the material from the prework,
plus give students an opportunity to discuss their questions and issues. Bootcamp Prep also
offers tips and tricks for working with a computer as a development tool.

## Online Tutorials

### Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line.

If you aren't already, this is a great time to get used to the command line. No matter which operating system you're using, this tutorial can help you feel confident using the command line to navigate your computer:

https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial

Please work through Sections 1 through 5 of this tutorial. Note: This tutorial is for everyone, even though the word "Linux" is in the title! The same commands work in Windows and MacOS terminals as well.

Also recommended from this tutorial: Section 14, which is a handy cheatsheet of commands. Feel free to explore the more advanced topics if you wish, but those topics are beyond the scope of the Code 201 course!

Using the terminal may feel a little scary at first, but stick with it and give it some practice. This is you, in charge of your computer. :]

### Git tutorials *(1-2 hours)*

**A.** There is a lot of useful information in the Udemy tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. Skim through it as you can while striving to acquire terminology and gaining an understanding of the large concepts. Learning about version control is one of the most challenging things in the first week of Code 201. Above all, for now, strive for a conceptual understanding of how version control works, and why we use it in software development. The details are much more easy to grasp once the concepts are in place.

**B.** For a little hands-on practice, complete the first three exercises in the following tutorial:

1. Introduction to Git Commits
1. Branching in Git
1. Merging in Git

## Purchase textbooks and read preliminary readings

### Purchase the required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Web Design with HTML &amp; CSS; JavaScript &amp; jQuery book set</a> by Jon Duckett

### Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class *(2-3 hours)*

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

- From the **HTML & CSS** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
- From the **JavaScript** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word, because we cover hundreds of pages of text in the first two weeks of the course. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. And be sure to read closely enough to come up with questions and observations based on your reading!
