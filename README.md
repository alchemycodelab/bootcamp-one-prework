# Preparing For Success: Prep-Work

## Why is this prep work important?

#### Success Indicators and Outcomes

**We ask that all students take this preparation work seriously, regardless of prior education or code exposure.** 
While most students adjust to the pace and intensity of the program over the first week or two, some students find that the adjustment period can create a cycle of incomplete work, struggle, and demoralizing outcomes that takes much longer to break.

We want you to have the best outcome possible, which is why we're asking you to go through this material on your own, in order to develop familiarity while practicing using your laptop as a development tool.  
Focus on putting in the hours and dedication, but _don’t worry about comprehension!_ This may seem counterintuitive, but our instructors will cover the material again, in different ways, while adding more practical knowledge applications.

**Avoid skipping, skimming, or skimping out on prep work.** Invest in yourself and your future career by taking the opportunity to expose yourself to some of the vast amount of information available online.

**The purpose of this prep work is to give you exposure and familiarity, _not_ comprehension or competency.** 
It is likely that you'll have way more questions than answers. The material may go over your head, things may still not make sense, and you probably haven't gained the ability to execute the material on your own. That's ok!  

You are being exposed to knowledge, syntax, and language-- which is not the same thing as knowing how to do something. The goal is for you to gain some base familiarity and pattern recognition, which will help you during actual class time when these topics are discussed in-depth.  

Prioritize the terminal and git tutorials, but don't go so deep that you sacrifice getting JavaScript, HTML and CSS exposure.

#### Grade % 

**This prep work is mandatory and counts as 5% of your Code 102 total course grade.** You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments shortly after you've completed the enrollment process.

#### Required for Code 201

Code 201 **requires students to complete this prep work assigned for the program**. This prep 
work gives enrolled students a clear, step-by-step guide for what they need to achieve **before they start classes**. We understand that some things will still be confusing and may not make sense. That's ok!

## Time Considerations

**Expect to spend a _minimum_ of several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed.** Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners.

#### The estimated time to complete all of the prep work outlined below (_not including breaks_) is **from 23 hours to 78 hours**.

* If you spend only an approximate 23 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **4 hours a day for 5 days**.

* If you spend approximately 45 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **6 hours a day for 7 days**.

* If you spend approximately 78 hours on the prep work, it would take you about **5 hours a day for 16 days**.

## Stretch:


If you finish the above prep work and have VS Code installed, try going through these tutorials using the VS Code Editor with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). 

If you do _not_ have a VS Code environment working you can also use a [JavaScript Environment hosted on Repl.it](https://repl.it/repls/StandardVirtualConfig).
