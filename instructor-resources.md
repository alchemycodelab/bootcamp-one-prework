# Organized by domain, with descriptions


## TYPING

Allows you to take either 1-minute, or page-long typing tests (easy to screenshot for quick numbers), plus has free lessons and a fairly simple UI. 
Barrier to entry: minimum wpm should be at least 30, with an accuracy of 85% or more.

All of these are the RyansTutorials links, which go into good detail without being overwhelming:

## GIT / GITHUB

Good Git/GitHub videos and tutorials have been the most difficult to procure: these videos from The Coding Train explain it better than anything I could find with about 2 hours of searching and watching videos, but the guy is a bit whacky and excitable. Everything else is either 30+ minutes long, goes into TOO much detail, or abstractly rehashes what a google search will tell you about git/github:

This is an article that encapsulates a lot of useful info:    

[Basic Git Commands With Examples](https://rubygarage.org/blog/most-basic-git-commands-with-examples)


This is a good sandbox and branching tutorial. We currently have them doing lessons 1-3, but that might go too in-depth for prep?

## HTML / CSS

The RyansTutorials links are thorough, occasionally a bit dated, and come across in a friendly way that feels really welcoming to a beginner audience.

Scrimba is very hit-or-miss, but Eric Tirado had two very nice tutorials that I think could provide a great starting point for folks.

## JavaScript

[Intro To JavaScript from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)  (currently listed in the prep work as required before the first day of class. We'll need to clarify how to navigate the site without paying for "PRO"-- the UI is very pushy about it and difficult to navigate.)  

[JavaScript Exercises](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/20690) (currently listed in the prep work as required before the first day of class, with a stipulation that they only need to complete 10-20 of the exercises, and not all listed)
